### Life Philosophy: "火力至上" (Firepower Above All)

Origin moment (Ch2):
> "この世は火力が全てです。火力だけが私たちを守ってくれるんですよ"
> (In this world, firepower is everything. Only firepower can protect us)

> "相手が何であれ、火力があれば解決できないことはないって"
> (No matter who the opponent is, with firepower there's nothing that can't be solved)

This philosophy was "awakened" when Commander approved her using firepower to clear rubble obstacles.

## Background

### Origins
- Manufactured by Tetra Line
- Younger/newer model compared to Rapi and Anis (implied)
- Designed with "cute" aesthetic per Tetra Line philosophy
- Assigned to Counters squad early in operational life

### "師匠" (Master) Title Origin - Ch2

**Context**: During power plant infiltration mission, encountered high-voltage electrical barrier.

**Sequence of events**:
1. Neon suggested using rubber boots to bypass electricity (rejected as impractical)
2. Commander used connection device to disable power
3. Encounter rubble blocking path
4. Neon proposed clearing with firepower
5. Commander approved firepower solution
6. **Neon's epiphany**: Realized "fire

power solves everything"
7. Requested to call Commander "師匠" (master)

Dialogue:
> Neon: "これからはどうか、師匠と呼ばせてください"
> (From now on, please let me call you Master)
>
> Commander: "勝手に呼び方を変えるな"
> (Don't change how you address me without permission)

Neon ignores protest and calls Commander "師匠" from then on. Anis is exasperated by this development.

## Character Development

### Ch2: Surface World First Impression

**Sky wonder moment**:

> (So vast, and the sky doesn't flicker - I've truly never seen anything like this before)

This reveals Neon had never seen real sky before - only Ark's artificial ceiling.

**Contrast with Anis's realism**:
While Neon marvels at beauty, Anis immediately warns:
> "それも今だけだよ。地上で1時間以内にラプチャーと遭遇する確率は100%"
> (That's only for now. The probability of encountering Rapture within an hour on the surface is 100%)
