### Identity Construction
Rapi's personality reflects classic Elysion military NIKKE design:

- Deeper understanding of mortality and sacrifice

### Core Motivations

2. Support Counters squad effectiveness
3. Prove value beyond being "disposable weapon"
4. Earn recognition as individual rather than tool
