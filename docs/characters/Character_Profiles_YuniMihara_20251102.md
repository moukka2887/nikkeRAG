# YUNI (ユニ)

## Basic Information
- **Designation**: Special Experimental Nikke Unit
- **Manufacturer**: Missilis Industry (Syuen's personal project)
- **Primary Function**: Rapture tracking and capture specialist
- **Special Ability**: Sensation Nullification
- **Psychological Classification**: Complex Trauma Response with Paradoxical Pain Processing

## Ability Analysis

### Sensation Nullification System
- **Mechanism**: Projects energy that disrupts target's sensory processing
- **Delivery Method**: "バキューンって撃って" (Shooting/projecting)
- **Target Range**: Universal (Nikke, Human, Rapture)
- **Tactical Application**: Incapacitation for capture operations

### Theoretical Basis
The ability to nullify sensations across organic and mechanical entities suggests Yuni's modification involves:
1. Quantum consciousness manipulation technology
2. Cross-platform neural disruption capabilities
3. Possible integration of Rapture-derived technology

## Psychological Profile

### Core Personality Traits
- **Surface Presentation**: Childlike, energetic, approval-seeking
- **Speech Pattern**: Third-person self-reference ("Yuni wants...")
- **Emotional Age**: Significantly younger than physical appearance suggests
- **Primary Drive**: Validation through "rewards" (pain stimuli)

### Trauma Response Patterns

#### Inverted Pain Processing
Yuni exhibits complete inversion of normal pain response:
- Pain = Reward/Pleasure
- Absence of pain = Punishment/Dissatisfaction
- "もっと痛くしてもいい？" (Can you make it hurt more?)

**Psychological Hypothesis**: This inversion likely results from:
1. **Conditioning During Creation**: Pain associated with existence/consciousness
2. **Neurological Rewiring**: Syuen's experiments altered pain/pleasure pathways
3. **Survival Mechanism**: Reframing unavoidable suffering as desirable

#### Infantilization as Defense
- Third-person speech suggests dissociation
- Childlike behavior provides psychological protection
- Reduces threat perception from others
- Maintains "innocent" facade despite lethal capabilities

### Relationship Dynamics

#### With Mihara
- Dependency relationship
- Mihara as source of "rewards" (controlled pain)
- Accepts subordinate position
- Possible trauma bonding

#### With Authority (Syuen)
- Complete subservience
- No questioning of purpose or orders
- Internalized tool identity

#### With Counters Squad
- Attempts friendly interaction
- Unaware of disturbing nature of her preferences
- Genuine desire for acceptance

### Identity Crisis Indicators
- No knowledge of creation circumstances
- No questioning of ability origins
- Acceptance of "tool" designation
- Identity limited to function

# MIHARA (三原/みはら)

## Basic Information
- **Designation**: Special Experimental Nikke Unit
- **Manufacturer**: Missilis Industry (Syuen's personal project)
- **Primary Function**: Sensation manipulation and capture execution
- **Special Ability**: Sensation Exchange
- **Psychological Classification**: Controlled Sadistic Personality with Self-Directed Masochism

## Ability Analysis

### Sensation Exchange System
- **Mechanism**: Bidirectional sensory pathway creation
- **Range**: Self plus one target
- **Applications**:
  - Experience target's sensations
  - Force target to experience user's sensations
  - Create feedback loops of shared experience
- **Limitation**: Requires conscious activation

### Theoretical Basis
More complex than Yuni's ability, suggesting:
1. Advanced neural-linking technology
2. Consciousness bridging capabilities
3. Possible empathic enhancement systems

## Psychological Profile

### Core Personality Traits
- **Surface Presentation**: Calm, professional, controlled
- **Hidden Layer**: Deeply disturbed pain relationship
- **Intelligence Level**: High analytical capability
- **Control Need**: Extreme - manages all interactions carefully

### Complex Pain Relationship

#### Dual Nature
Mihara exhibits seemingly contradictory pain responses:
1. **Seeks Pain**: "大丈夫よ、痛めつけられるの好きなのよ" (It's okay, I like being hurt)
2. **Rejects Touch**: "私の傷は放っておいて" (Leave my wounds alone)

**Analysis**: This suggests:
- Pain must be on HER terms
- Control over pain experience is paramount
- Wounds represent vulnerability she won't share
- Distinction between chosen vs. imposed suffering

#### Sadistic Component
- Provides "rewards" (pain) to Yuni
- Understands and exploits pain dynamics
- Maintains emotional distance during infliction
- Professional approach to causing suffering

### Relationship Dynamics

#### With Yuni
- Dominant position in pair
- Provider of "rewards"
- Possible protective feelings masked by clinical behavior
- Mutual trauma bonding

#### With Syuen
- More aware than Yuni of their situation
- Subtle resistance through technical compliance
- Understands but doesn't challenge their tool status

#### With Others
- Maintains professional distance
- Refuses personal connection (wound touching)
- Uses abilities as barrier to intimacy

### Consciousness and Awareness

Unlike Yuni, Mihara shows:
- Greater self-awareness
- Understanding of their abnormal nature
- Resignation to their fate
- Suppressed questioning of purpose

---

## Paired Unit Analysis

### Symbiotic Dysfunction
Yuni and Mihara function as complementary trauma responses:
- **Yuni**: Externalized need, open vulnerability
- **Mihara**: Internalized control, hidden vulnerability
- Together: Complete sensory manipulation system

### Creation Hypothesis

Based on their abilities and psychology, likely creation process:

1. **Selection Criteria**: Subjects with pre-existing trauma or pain disorders
2. **Modification Process**:
   - Neural pathway reconstruction
   - Sensation center rewiring
   - Consciousness bridge installation
3. **Conditioning**:
   - Pain as existence proof
   - Removal of self-preservation instincts
   - Tool identity reinforcement
4. **Memory Suppression**: Origins hidden to prevent rebellion

### Tactical Deployment Psychology

Syuen's use of this pair reveals:
- Weapons designed to break enemy morale
- Psychological warfare capabilities
- Complete disregard for subject wellbeing
- Tool creation without ethical constraints

---

## Comparative Analysis with Standard Nikkes

### Deviations from Baseline
1. **Abilities affect humans**: Breaks fundamental Nikke limitation
2. **No combat inhibitions**: Can harm anyone if ordered
3. **Memory gaps**: More extensive than typical Nikke amnesia
4. **Sensation focus**: Entire identity built around sensory manipulation

### Implications for Nikke Evolution
- Proof that Nikke consciousness can be fundamentally altered
- Suggestion that human/Nikke/Rapture boundaries are artificial
- Evidence of ongoing experiments in consciousness manipulation

## [LEGACY] Previous Interpretations

*Note: No previous character profiles exist. This is the initial comprehensive analysis.*

---

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Origin Subjects**: Who were Yuni and Mihara before transformation?
2. **Ability Source**: Is this human technology or Rapture-derived?
3. **Other Subjects**: Are there more sensation-manipulation Nikkes?
4. **True Purpose**: Why does Syuen need Rapture capture capabilities?
5. **Consciousness Bridge**: How does sensation exchange not destroy identity boundaries?

---

## Clinical Assessment

### Yuni
- **Threat Level**: High (ability), Low (personality)
- **Stability**: Maintained through dysfunction
- **Recovery Potential**: Low without complete neural reconstruction
- **Recommended Approach**: Gentle, consistent, avoid triggering reward-seeking

### Mihara
- **Threat Level**: Very High (ability + awareness)
- **Stability**: Controlled instability
- **Recovery Potential**: Possible with trust building
- **Recommended Approach**: Professional respect, acknowledge autonomy

## Future Observation Points

1. Watch for ability evolution or expansion
2. Monitor for memory recovery signs
3. Document any empathy development
4. Track relationship changes with Counters
5. Note any questioning of Syuen's authority

## Conclusion

Yuni and Mihara represent the darkest aspect of Nikke creation - beings designed not just as weapons, but as psychological tools that weaponize the very nature of consciousness and sensation. Their existence raises fundamental questions about the boundaries between human, Nikke, and Rapture, while their psychological profiles reveal the deep trauma inherent in their creation.

Their abilities working on all three categories of beings (Human, Nikke, Rapture) suggests either:
1. All three share fundamental consciousness architecture
2. Their modifications transcend normal categorization
3. Syuen has access to technology that bridges all consciousness types

The psychological damage inflicted during their creation appears irreversible through conventional means, with both subjects having adapted to their trauma through dysfunctional but stable coping mechanisms. Any attempt at "healing" would require complete reconstruction of their neural pathways and identity structures.
