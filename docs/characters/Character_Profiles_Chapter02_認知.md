**[第09章重要揭露 - 真實身份]**:
根據第09章揭露，從第02章開始出現的「Shifty（謝芙蒂）」實際上是**Missilis CEO舒恩（Shuen，代號：終焉/Siren/Scene）使用深度偽裝技術（Deepfake）冒充的**。舒恩花了一個月準備這次偽裝，目的是滲透中央政府情報部門Protocol Squad，調查Unchained（關鍵道具）並監視Excia的黑客行動。真正的Shifty當時在常規訓練營。

**重新解讀第02章行為**:
- 所有「Shifty」的行為實際上都是Missilis CEO親自執行
- 這是CEO級別的企業間諜行動
- 粒子掃描和戰術建議都是舒恩提供的
- 這解釋了為什麼「Shifty」在第08章會志願成為Counters專屬Operator——舒恩需要更接近調查目標
