**The Excia Paradox**

**NIMPH System Revelation (Encrypted Channel)**
Excia discovered and revealed the complete truth through encrypted communication:

- **NIMPH Full Name**: Neuro-Implanted Machine for Protecting Human
- **Three Functions**: Clear (delete), Store (backup), Write (overwrite)
- **Immortality Mechanism**: NIMPH periodically backs up synaptic states
- **Memory Control**: Brain information can be controlled at will
- **Resurrection Process**: Backup memories overwrite formatted brain
- **Physical Limit**: Only works if brain is not physically destroyed
- **Unchained Connection**: Unchained contact agent destroys NIMPH
- **Liberation Meaning**: Destroying NIMPH = freeing from immortality

**Critical Quotes**
> "皆さん、私は脳を燃やします。秘密は重要ですから"
> (Everyone, I will burn my brain. Because secrets are important)

> "NIMPH——Neuro-Implanted Machine for Protecting Human"
> "只要大腦不遭到物理破壞，就是不滅的存在"
> (As long as the brain is not physically destroyed, it is an immortal existence)

> "Unchained接觸劑可以摧毀Nikke大腦裡面的NIMPH，這就是解脫不死之身的原因"
> (Unchained contact agent can destroy NIMPH in NIKKE brains, this is the reason for liberation from immortality)

**Unresolved Questions**
- How did she survive execution? (Answered: NIMPH backup system)
- Who sent the encrypted message? (Likely pre-death Excia)
- What happened during the 6-hour gap? (NIMPH restoration process)
- Is this the original Excia? (Philosophical question: backup = original?)
