## Supporting Analysis

### Operator Behavioral Guidelines

**Revealed Protocol**
"オペレーターの行動指針にニケに心を許すながある"
- Operators forbidden from emotional attachment to Nikke
- Reason: High Nikke casualty rates cause operator trauma
- Shifty's violation: Cannot maintain emotional distance

**Systemic Implications**
- Suggests widespread Nikke losses
- Operator burnout as organizational concern
- Human-Nikke relationship restrictions beyond physical

## Character Continuity Validation

### Consistency Check Results

**Aligned Elements**
✓ Shifty's presence in Chapter 02 establishes prior relationship
✓ Anis's spy identity joke from early chapters referenced
✓ Neon's enthusiasm consistent with rookie status
✓ Rapi's calm demeanor maintained
✓ Commander's recent promotion from Chapter 07 acknowledged

**New Revelations (Not Contradictions)**
- Shifty's emotional investment (hidden previously)
- Anis's deep paranoia (escalation of existing cynicism)
- Neon's backbone (growth from naive rookie)
- Rapi's memory immunity (previously unknown)

**Potential Inconsistencies**
⚠ Rapi's 3-year-old memories vs. timeline placement needs investigation
⚠ Shifty's knowledge of classified information unexplained
⚠ Anis's paranoia intensity seems sudden but may relate to off-screen events

## Narrative Impact Assessment

### Character Development Vectors

**Trust Dynamics**
- Trust breakdown threatens team cohesion
- Recovery through crisis (minefield, particle cannon)
- New equilibrium: "Earned trust" vs "blind trust"

**Identity Themes**
- Shifty: Professional identity vs. human emotion
- Anis: Paranoid protector vs. team member
- Neon: Rookie vs. independent thinker
- Rapi: Normal Nikke vs. anomalous entity

**Future Plot Seeds**
1. Rapi's memory immunity will likely become central
2. Shifty's past losses may connect to larger narrative
3. Anis's hidden trauma awaits revelation
4. Operator-Nikke boundaries will be tested
