## Technology & Combat Systems

### [INTRODUCED] 感覚交換技術 (Sensory Exchange Technology)
**Japanese**: 感覚交換 (かんかくこうかん)
**First Appearance**: Chapter 02
**Developer**: Missilis Industry
**Function**: Swaps sensory perception between two targets
**Mechanics**:
- Works on humans, Nikke, and Rapture
- Enables remote torture and control
- Pain inflicted on one party is felt by another
- Can be weaponized for interrogation or punishment

**Known Users**:
- Mihara (Three/三原) - Primary operator
- Syuen - Orders its use for torture

**Tactical Applications**:
- Punishment without physical damage to valuable assets
- Forcing compliance through proxy pain
- Demonstrating absolute control

**Ethical Implications**: Represents the dehumanization of Nikke and the corporate abuse of technology for oppression.

---

### [INTRODUCED] Rapture機械操作能力 (Rapture Machine Operation)
**Discovery Date**: Chapter 02 events
**Significance**: First documented case of Rapture using human technology
**Location**: Power Plant control room
**Observer**: Shifty, Counters Squad

**Details**:
- Rapture observed operating control panels
- Suggests learning capability or pre-programmed knowledge
- Contradicts previous understanding of Rapture as purely destructive
- No prior historical precedent

**Strategic Implications**:
- Rapture may compromise human infrastructure
- Defense systems could be turned against humans
- Suggests Rapture intelligence evolution

**Future Development**: Links to Tokutive's enhanced intelligence (Chapter 03-04)

---

### 火力至上主義 (Firepower Supremacy Philosophy)
**Japanese**: 火力が全て (かりょくがすべて)
**Proponent**: Neon
**Established**: Chapter 02, during first surface mission

**Core Tenets**:
- "Firepower is everything"
- "Only firepower can protect us"
- All problems can be solved with sufficient firepower
- Simplicity over complexity

**Practical Applications**:
- Clearing debris with gunfire
- Direct assault preferred over stealth
- Maximum firepower deployment

**Cultural Impact**: Becomes Neon's defining characteristic and combat philosophy throughout the series.

---

### Evulra粒子 (Evulra Particles)
**Function**: Environmental hazard indicator
**Measurement**: Percentage concentration
**Safe Threshold**: <2% (relative safety)
**Chapter 02 Reading**: 2.01%

**Properties**:
- Indicates Rapture presence/activity
- Higher concentration = greater danger
- Continuously monitored during surface operations
- Can spike rapidly during Rapture attacks

**Detection**: Shifty's scanning systems provide real-time readings

---

### Nikke身體重整技術 (Nikke Body Reconstruction)
**Demonstrated**: Rapi's complete reconstruction after destruction
**Requirements**: Brain/head unit intact
**Time Frame**: Several hours to days
**Success Rate**: Near 100% if brain survives

**Process**:
- Head unit preserved and transported
- New body constructed or repaired
- Memory and personality retained
- Full combat capability restored

**Philosophical Impact**: Raises questions about identity, mortality, and what constitutes "death" for Nikke.

---

## Organizations & Power Structures

**Corporate Culture**:
- Views Nikke as tools/products
- Employs torture for compliance
- Pursues dangerous experimental technology

---

### 三大企業 (Three Major Corporations)
**Members**:
1. Missilis Industry (confirmed Chapter 02)
2. Elysion (mentioned, Absolute squad)
3. Tetra Line (revealed Chapter 04)

**Collective Powers**:
- Nikke production monopoly
- Military command authority
- Resource allocation control
- Judicial powers (can order executions)

**Check on Power**: Apparently none demonstrated in Chapter 02

---

### [INTRODUCED] Wardress特殊部隊
**Affiliation**: Missilis Industry
**Type**: Experimental Nikke unit
**Known Members**:
- Mihara (Three/三原) - Sensory exchange
- Yuni (ユニ) - Abilities not fully revealed in Chapter 02

**Purpose**:
- CEO's personal enforcement unit
- Experimental ability testing
- Demonstration of corporate power

**Operational Status**: Forced cooperation with Counters for punishment mission

---

### Counters小隊
**Status**: "Problem children" unit
**Base**: Relocated to Outpost (Chapter 02)
**Members**:
- Commander (human)
- Rapi (former Absolute)
- Anis ("problem child")
- Neon (possible spy)

**Reputation**: Expendable, problematic, but effective
**Current Mission**: Forced Rapture capture operation

---

## Locations

### [INTRODUCED] 前哨基地 (Outpost/Forward Base)
**Location**: Surface, far from Ark
**Condition**: Desolate, abandoned
**Facilities**:
- Makeshift barracks (warehouse-level)
- Non-functional showers (no water)
- Expired food supplies
- Commander's quarters (slightly better)

**Purpose**:
- Punishment assignment location
- Forward observation post
- Isolation from Ark resources

**Strategic Value**: Minimal, primarily punitive
**Freedom Level**: High (no oversight, can fire weapons freely)

---

### 発電所 (Power Plant)
**Status**: Destroyed (Chapter 02 events)
**Original Function**: Resource storage, power generation
**Value**: 2 months of Ark operational resources

**Significance of Loss**:
- Major strategic setback
- Triggered Commander's exile
- Demonstrated cost of tactical decisions

**Discovery**: Site where Rapture machine operation first observed

---

### 排水路 (Drainage System)
**Type**: Underground infiltration route
**Condition**: Functional but hazardous
**Hazards**:
- Toxic odors
- Structural instability
- Limited visibility

**Tactical Advantage**: Avoids surface Rapture concentrations
